/**
 * PUBLIC, UNAUTHENTICATED proposal view. The only route in this module that a
 * signed-out visitor can reach.
 *
 * MIDDLEWARE
 *   `proxy.ts` runs `updateSession()` on every non-asset path, but that function
 *   only gates `/employee/*` and `/m/*` (`isPortalRoute`). `/proposals/share/*`
 *   matches neither, so the request falls straight through to
 *   `NextResponse.next()` with the portal security headers attached. No
 *   middleware change is required to reach this page, and none was made — auth
 *   middleware is a CLAUDE.md stop condition.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL — what a holder of a token can reach
 *   ALLOWED:  the single revision their link is bound to, rendered exactly as
 *             <ProposalDocument> renders it internally, plus an acceptance form.
 *   DENIED:   every other proposal, every other revision of this proposal, the
 *             live working copy, the internal pricing catalog (the generator
 *             iframe is never mounted here), the meta/assignment sidebar,
 *             revision history, owner/value/client_id, any employee identity,
 *             and any authenticated route. The page reads through
 *             `resolveShareLink()`, which returns a hand-built allow-list
 *             projection and nothing else.
 *   REJECTED: unknown, malformed, expired and revoked tokens all render the
 *             SAME panel, so the response cannot be used to probe whether a
 *             proposal exists behind a given token.
 *
 * The page is force-dynamic: a cached render would serve one client's document
 * to whoever asked next, and would silently stop honouring revocation.
