import "server-only";

// Server-only resolution of a raw share token into the exact, minimal set of
// facts the unauthenticated /proposals/share/[token] route is allowed to see.
//
// WHY THE SERVICE-ROLE CLIENT
//   The share route has no session. The alternatives were:
//     (a) grant `anon` a SELECT policy on client_proposal_share_links — which
//         would let ANY anonymous caller list every link, its proposal id, its
//         expiry and its token hash. Rejected.
//     (b) resolve the token here, server-side, with the service-role client and
//         hand back only a hand-built projection. Chosen.
//   The service-role key is used strictly inside this server-only module —
//   never in a client component (CLAUDE.md SECURITY STANDARDS).
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE WILL NOT RETURN
//   Nothing beyond the shared revision's document state and the handful of
//   proposal fields the client-facing document itself already prints. In
//   particular it never returns: client_id, owner, proposal_value, created_by,
//   body_markdown, other proposals, other revisions, other share links, any
//   employee identity, or the internal pricing catalog. The projection is an
//   explicit allow-list, not a `select *` with fields removed later.
//
// This module deliberately holds no policy of its own — every "may this link be
// used?" decision comes from ./share-link-policy, which is pure and unit-tested.
