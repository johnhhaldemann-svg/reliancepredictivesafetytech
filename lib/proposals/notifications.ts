// approval / approval-server and share-link-policy / share-link-server.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: submit-for-review, client acceptance and client decline were
// all silent. The maker-checker handoff and the two events that decide whether
// the company gets paid reached nobody, so the only way to learn a deal had
// closed was to reopen the proposals list.
