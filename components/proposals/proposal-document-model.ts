// Ported from the `update()` renderer in assets/proposal-generator-v15.html: the
// asset builds the whole document by writing strings into `innerHTML` on every
// keystroke. Everything that document derives — party blocks, package pills,
// scope headings, deliverables, the fee table, the schedule sentence, and the
// 28 commercial/legal terms — is derived HERE instead, so:
//
//   * <ProposalDocument> stays declarative JSX (React escapes every value; the
//     module keeps no raw-HTML sink after its stored-XSS fix), and
//   * this logic is unit-testable under the repo's node-environment vitest
//     setup, which has no DOM/component test harness.
//
// Every number comes from computeProposalTotals(). Nothing here recomputes
// pricing, and nothing trusts a persisted numeric value directly.
